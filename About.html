    <p>Simply put, empowerment means guiding your child in a manner that encourages their belief in their own abilities and potential for positive growth. During their school years and when they move into adult life, children will need to rely on their inner strength and sense of self-belief to meet and overcome difficulties.Meaning of children’s human rights education
    Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions
    that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.[4][9][10] It is a form of education
    that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right,
    that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values
    and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal
    obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
    
    Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and
    practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a
    systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown
    children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather,
    the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across
    subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and
    practices.[11]Sir William Blackstone (1765-9) recognized three parental duties to the child: maintenance, protection, and
    education.[10] In modern language, the child has a right to receive these from the parent.
    
    The League of Nations adopted the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child (1924), which enunciated the child's
    right to receive the requirements for normal development, the right of the hungry child to be fed, the right of the sick
    child to receive health care, the right of the backward child to be reclaimed, the right of orphans to shelter, and the
    right to protection from exploitation.[11]
    
    The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) in Article 25(2) recognized the need of motherhood and
    childhood to "special protection and assistance" and the right of all children to "social protection".[12]
    
    The United Nations General Assembly adopted the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child (1959), which
    enunciated ten principles for the protection of children's rights, including the universality of rights, the right to
    special protection, and the right to protection from discrimination, among other rights.[13]
    
    Consensus on defining children's rights has become clearer in the last fifty years.[14] A 1973 publication by Hillary
    Clinton (then an attorney) stated that children's rights were a "slogan in need of a definition".[15] According to some
    researchers, the notion of children's rights is still not well defined, with at least one proposing that there is no
    singularly accepted definition or theory of the rights held by children.[16]
    
    Children's rights law is defined as the point where the law intersects with a child's life. That includes juvenile
    delinquency, due process for children involved in the criminal justice system, appropriate representation, and effective
    rehabilitative services; care and protection for children in state care; ensuring education for all children regardless
    of their race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability, color, ethnicity, or
    other characteristics, and; health care and advocacy.[17]</p>
