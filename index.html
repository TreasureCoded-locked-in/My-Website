    <p>Children's rights education is the teaching and practice of children's rights in schools, educational programmes or
    institutions, as informed by and consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. When fully
    implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights,
    and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles 29 and 42 of the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.
    
    In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of childrenâ€™s rights to children and to
    adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making
    them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights.
    Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence
    of this.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the
    child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of
    the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or
    built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100
    years of struggle.[8]</p>
