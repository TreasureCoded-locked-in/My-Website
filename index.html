    <p>Children's rights education is the teaching and practice of children's rights in schools, educational programmes or
    institutions, as informed by and consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. When fully
    implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights,
    and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles 29 and 42 of the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.
    
    In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to
    adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making
    them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights.
    Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence
    of this.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the
    child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of
    the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or
    built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100
    years of struggle.[8][There] is a mass of human rights law, both treaty and 'soft law', both general and child-specific, which recognises the
    distinct status and particular requirements of children. [Children], owing to their particular vulnerability and their
    significance as the future generation, are entitled to special treatment generally, and, in situations of danger, to
    priority in the receipt of assistance and protection.
    
    — Jenny Kuper, International Law Concerning Child Civilians in Armed Conflict (1997, Clarendon Press)
    As minors by law, children do not have autonomy or the right to make decisions on their own for themselves in any known
    jurisdiction of the world. Instead their adult caregivers, including parents, social workers, teachers, youth workers,
    and others, are vested with that authority, depending on the circumstances.[5] Some believe that this state of affairs
    gives children insufficient control over their own lives and causes them to be vulnerable.[6] Louis Althusser has gone
    so far as to describe this legal machinery, as it applies to children, as "repressive state apparatuses".[7]
    
    Structures such as government policy have been held by some commentators to mask the ways adults abuse and exploit
    children, resulting in child poverty, lack of educational opportunities, and child labour. On this view, children are to
    be regarded as a minority group towards whom society needs to reconsider the way it behaves.[8]
    
    Researchers have identified children as needing to be recognized as participants in society whose rights and
    responsibilities need to be recognized at all ages.[9]</p>
